# TCP/IP

The OSI Model we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. 

TCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike the seven layers in the OSI model.

The number of layers is sometimes referred to as five or four. Here In this article, we’ll study five layers. The Physical Layer and Data Link Layer are referred to as one single layer as the ‘Physical Layer’ or ‘Network Interface Layer’ in the 4-layer reference.
