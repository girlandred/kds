## Protocols

TCP/IP Model covers many Internet Protocols. The main rule of these Internet Protocols is how the data is validated and sent over the Internet. Some Common Internet Protocols include:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP takes care of Web Browsers and Websites. 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP takes care of how the file is to be sent over the Internet.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is used to send and receive data.
